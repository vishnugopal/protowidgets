Protoboxen is a Javascript library designed to generate linkable, labelable and draggable CSS boxes.

Depends on:
* prototype
* scriptaculous

These are distributed with protoboxen in the lib/ directory. 

You generate a box with the following syntax:

var box1 = new Protobox({ id: "box1", draggable: true, label: "Menu", left: 200, top: 100 });

Protobox takes the following options:
id (required): The DOM id of the box.
draggable (optional): The box can be dragged if true.
label (optional): Either "true" (in which case the label is "Untitled") or the label text. Labels if present are editable by double-clicking on them.
left: The left position of the box.
top: The top position of the box.

You link two boxes with the following syntax:

box4.link({to: box2, relationship: "child"});

takes two parameters:
to: the target box, must be a Protobox object.
relationship: either "child" or "parent"

Here box4 is the "child" of box2.

A box can have multiple children and multiple parents, we're kinda promiscuous that way :)

Demo:
See test.html for a demo.


More hints:
* Change the arrow-end.gif to have a transparent background in case you're not working with a white background.
* Subclass Protobox and use a different class_name property to style things differently and to add more functionality.

Deploy:
You might wish to use a javascript dependency management system (like sprockets) when you deploy.


Tested on Safari 4 and Firefox 3. I dunno about IE, if there are problems, patches welcome!
